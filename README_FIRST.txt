This is still a test project i created cause i was bored and wanted to help my mother with her work.

It uses java and mysql to create student marks records and convert them into .png (or jpg if yoyu edit the code) files for each student.

It create every database or table by itself but -
    1. You should have mysql server configured at localhost
    2. I have used user - root and password -123456
    3. you can configure your mysql server to use this user and password or you can change it as you wish in "pract.java" file.

Not all the buttons work but will add functionality later on if required(or you can modify to your will).

There is still a slight alignment error while exporting files to images but it looks fine.

Well that's all there is to it. Use and modify it as you wish.
